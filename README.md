# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohamed Sameh

AI Engineer with experience in computer vision, NLP, and end-to-end deep learning solutions.  
I’ve worked extensively on healthcare-related AI projects, but I'm equally passionate about LLMs, generative AI, and real-world automation.

## 🛠️ Projects
- **Maxilla & Mandible Detection**: Deep learning model on 3D CBCT data, custom CIOU loss, integrated into clinical pipeline.
- **Kidney Stone Detection App**: YOLO + OpenCV, Streamlit web app for user interaction.
- **Face Recognition Tool**: DeepFace embeddings + PyQT interface.
- **Chat With Your PDF App**: Built a RAG-based app to query PDF content using LangChain and Groq ‎LLMs. Implemented history-aware question reformulation, FAISS-based retrieval, and real-time chat UI ‎with Streamlit. Used HuggingFace embeddings and sentence chunking for document parsing.‎
- **Mathematics Agent**: Developed a math-focused AI assistant using LangChain’s ReAct agent framework and Groq-served Gemma2 LLM. Integrated numeric calculator and Wikipedia search tools, engineering prompts to enforce math-only behavior with polite refusal of unrelated queries.
- **House Price Prediction**: ML model with Flask web deployment.
- **Stroke Prediction**: SVM, KNN, RF on health data with full preprocessing.
